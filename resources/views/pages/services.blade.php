                                    We utilize the most precise and technologically accurate tools available in our field ranging from radon detection devices, combustible gas detectors, and moisture meters. We will employ each device during your inspection to help eliminate as much guess work as possible.

                                    The practice of home inspections is an integral part of any real estate transaction. We are sensitive to the privacy of homeowners and we respect your property. We strive to leave things exactly as we find them and will do everything in our power to leave no trace of our visit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A typical inspection takes 2-3 hours. The exterior of the house is our normal starting point. We may go up on the roof, and then proceed around the outside of the house. From there, we go into the basement to examine the major systems of the house. Included are the structure, the heating and air conditioning systems, the electrical service, and plumbing system.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After completing our work in the basement, we go through the rest of the house. We test all the plumbing fixtures, operate windows and doors, look under sinks, in closets, and go up into the attic. The New Age Home Detectives do no destructive testing. We may, however, need to leave behind a radon sensing device that is sensitive to motion. We will attempt to leave it in an area that will not be an inconvenience for you but ask that you please try to avoid touching the device in any way during the test period.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Our goal is to fairly and accurately report on the condition of the home. Our intention is not to "nitpick," nor do we feel compelled to find problems to justify our existence. At The New Age Home Detectives we strive to keep our findings in perspective for our clients. If a recommendation we make is typical for homes of that age, or for homes in the area, the buyer will be told that.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While some owners prefer to be home when we do our inspections, others find it easier to leave the house. Either situation is fine with us. We cannot discuss our findings or release a report to anyone without our client's permission.
                                </p>
                                <p>
